# SÃ©rgio Tiago Matias's CV

Welcome to my personal CV repository. Here you'll find all the necessary files to understand my professional background, skills, and experiences.

## Repository Contents

- `CV-SergioTiagoMatias.pdf`: This is the latest version of my Curriculum Vitae in PDF format for easy viewing and printing.
- `CV_Picture.png`: A professional headshot photograph used in the CV.
- `main.tex`: The LaTeX source file for my CV. You can use this to compile and create your own version of my CV if necessary.

## Compiling the CV from Source

If you wish to compile the CV from the LaTeX source:

Run the LaTeX engine on `main.tex`. Something like:
`pdflatex main.tex`
